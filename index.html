        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Daniel. I'm currently a sophomore studying computer engineering at Purdue 
            University. I aim to pursue concentrations in Computer Systems and AI/ML. 
            
            I'm passionate about learning and exploring new things! I'm 
            currently reading up on Computer Architecture. In my free time I enjoy sports/weightlifting, 
        </p>
